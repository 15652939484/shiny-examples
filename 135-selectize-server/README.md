This application demonstrates Shiny's ability to dynamically load selectize's input data from the server, with both single and multiple selectize options.

Check the server-side selectize box to load the selectize input from the server. This allows Shiny to filter large inputs into manageable sizes for the browser. You can also check the set selected box to default selected inputs.
